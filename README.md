# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I thought I'd have a go with Go again (it's been a while since I used it, so I feel like I'm learning it all over again). I'm not sure I'll have the time or inclination to do that many of the puzzles, but let's see how it goes :)

Example usage:

```
go install github.com/jsdw/advent-of-code-2023@latest

./advent-of-code-2023 -day 1 -star 1 -input inputs/day01.txt
```
